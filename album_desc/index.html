	<h3> Olafur Arnalds, Album Cover & Times New Roman </h3>
	<ul>
	<li>
	<p>My plan with this was to create a very minimalistic
	cover for the album to evoke more of a 
	calm theme that goes with the music.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>I chose a neutral color palette, because this doesn't
	feel too over whelming. I wanted everything here to be organized
	in a centered way.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The overall layout I feel is appropriate for this type, 
	because it is meant for new paper print, and book print. 
	I felt that I used this type in a book styled manner of type placement.
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>I varied between Times New Roman regular, bold, italic, and bold italic to give the cover some variation instead of being flat and still by just using regular..

	<h3> Olafur Arnalds, Album Cover & Times New Roman </h3>
	<ul>
	<li>
	<p>With the inside sleeve/card I wanted to keep this similar to the rest of the style.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>I designed this to be very centered like the outside cover, and to also match the style of a printed book within the paragraph style.</p>
	</li>
